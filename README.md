Code for Titanic Survival Prediction

Made a .ipynb(Jupyter Notebook) file which compares 9 different models. The 9 models are : 1.) Random Forest 2.) Decision Tree 3.) k nearest neighbor 4.) Logistic Regression 5.) Linear Support Vector Classifier 6.) Perceptron 7.) Support Vector Machines 8.) Stochastic Gradient Decent 9.) Naive Bayes

The raw data is processed and analyze, identify patterns for the best model to apply.
